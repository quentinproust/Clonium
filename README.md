# Clonium

Hello 

The Clonium project is about creating a game.
The rules are :
- At the beginning of the game, you have as much as there is player a certain number of cases with a chips set with
a value set to 1.
- Each time someone has to play, he has to click on a case that contains one of his chips.
- When someone play on his chips the value of this chips will increase of 1.
- when a chip value reach 4, the chip on this case will disappear (chip value then is 0 ) and the adjacent case will have their chips be increasing of 1.
- If one of those case belongs to someone different than the owner of the case that has disappeared then the chip on the case will change of owner.
- If there is no chips one of those cases then it will create one chips of value 1 and having as new Owner the player whose chip disappeared.
- The game ends when only one player have remaining chips on the field.


The project is fully-coded in Java and will contains following ressources :

-Two JFrames
  -The first one to show the players the state of the game. (the fields) 
  -The other one will allows the players to input by clicking JButton how many person will be playing.

This is the end of the explanation on the Clonium Project.
